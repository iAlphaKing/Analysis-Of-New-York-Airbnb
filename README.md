# Analysis-Of-New-York-Airbnb

Project Overview

	•	Conducted a comprehensive analysis of New York Airbnb data using big data technologies.
	•	Focused on data cleaning, profiling, transformation, and visualization to derive actionable insights.
	•	Investigated factors influencing pricing, occupancy, and customer reviews in the Airbnb market.

Tools and Technologies Used

	•	Big Data Frameworks: Apache Spark, PySpark.
	•	Cloud Services: Amazon S3.
	•	Programming Languages: Python, Scala.
	•	Visualization Tools: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly.
	•	Data Storage: Hive.

Key Contributions

	1.	Data Cleaning and Transformation:
	•	Removed missing values, duplicates, and outliers to prepare the dataset for analysis.
	•	Standardized and renamed columns, and cleaned string fields for consistency.
	•	Converted raw data into structured fields using PySpark.
	2.	Data Profiling and Analysis:
	•	Profiled large datasets using PySpark to identify patterns and inconsistencies.
	•	Performed exploratory data analysis to understand key trends in pricing, occupancy rates, and customer reviews.
	3.	Data Visualization:
	•	Created interactive charts and graphs to display trends in Airbnb data, such as:
	•	Neighborhood distribution and density of listings.
	•	Price vs. room type across different neighborhoods.
	•	Occupancy rates, reviews per month, and instant bookings by area.
	•	Used Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate scatter plots, radar charts, and bar graphs.
	4.	Comparison of Tools:
	•	Evaluated the advantages and limitations of PySpark, Hive, and Scala for data processing and analysis.
	•	Demonstrated proficiency in handling large-scale data efficiently using these tools.

Outcomes and Observations

	•	Identified key drivers of Airbnb pricing, such as room type, location, and minimum nights.
	•	Discovered trends in Airbnb bookings, including the impact of reviews and customer ratings on occupancy rates.
	•	Highlighted the popularity of certain property types and neighborhoods for Airbnb listings.

Future Scope of Work

	•	Proposed implementing time-series analysis for predicting seasonal pricing trends.
	•	Suggested sentiment analysis of customer reviews to further enhance listing recommendations.
	•	Recommended spatial analysis to identify Airbnb hotspots near tourism destinations.
